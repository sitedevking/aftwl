After school, he enjoys playing different games with his friends. At home, he is helpful with small errands which he runs with so much pride. Cheikh lives with his parents and siblings in a village located in the central part of the country. They live in a family house which they share with other close relatives. His father owns a small business whereas his mother is a brave housewife who stays at home to do the house chores and take care of the family.
